excerpt: "Welcome to the SIAM Student Chapter at Stony Brook University! Our Chapter's goal is to unite members of the SBU student body with a common love for applied mathematics. This is an interdisciplinary and interdepartmental student society, welcoming students at any level of higher education (graduate or undergraduate), and acts as a hub for networking, skill-building, and academic exploration. The only prerequisite to come to meetings and events is a curiosity for any application of math! If you're interested in joining the Chapter or want to receive updates on future meetings and events, please send an email to siam_student_chapter@stonybrook.edu"
