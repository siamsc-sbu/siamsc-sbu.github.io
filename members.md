**Nilesh Chaturvedi**

**President**

“<font size=”1”>”I am the President and a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics where I conduct research on numerical analysis and scientific computing. I work under the advisement of Prof. Xiangmin Jiao on optimal preconditioning techniques for time-dependent PDEs and discontinuity detection in multiphysics applications. In my free time, I like cycling, playing basketball, and table tennis.</font>”

**Carole Hall**

**Vice President**

“<font size=”1”>”I am the Vice President of Stony Brook University's SIAM Student Chapter, and a third year PhD student in the Applied Math and Statistics Department studying Computational Biology. Before coming to SBU, I graduated from the University of Minnesota in 2020 with a BS in Mathematical Biology and Genomics, and my previous research includes algebraic combinatorics and number theory, cancer epigenetics, and dynamical systems relating to both climate and medicine. Currently, I perform research under Dr. Heather Lynch in the Ecology and Evolution Department, where I explore geometric problems relating to penguins in Antarctica. Most of my work pertains to image processing of satellite and UAV imagery, shape modeling and computational geometry, physics-based simulation, and statistical modeling. I also am an Associate with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, where I collaborate with an imaging scientist on my current PhD research. Outside of my studies and research, I enjoy long-distance running and cycling, backpacking, climbing, drawing, and photographing nature. </font>”
