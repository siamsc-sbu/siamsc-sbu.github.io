**President: Nilesh Chaturvedi**


 I am the President and a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics where I conduct research on numerical analysis and scientific computing. I work under the advisement of Prof. Xiangmin Jiao on optimal preconditioning techniques for time-dependent PDEs and discontinuity detection in multiphysics applications. In my free time, I like cycling, playing basketball, and table tennis.

**Vice President: Carole Hall**

 I am the Vice President of Stony Brook University's SIAM Student Chapter, and a third year PhD student in the Applied Math and Statistics Department studying Computational Biology. Before coming to SBU, I graduated from the University of Minnesota in 2020 with a BS in Mathematical Biology and Genomics, and my previous research includes algebraic combinatorics and number theory, cancer epigenetics, and dynamical systems relating to both climate and medicine. Currently, I perform research under Dr. Heather Lynch in the Ecology and Evolution Department, where I explore geometric problems relating to penguins in Antarctica. Most of my work pertains to image processing of satellite and UAV imagery, shape modeling and computational geometry, physics-based simulation, and statistical modeling. I also am an Associate with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, where I collaborate with an imaging scientist on my current PhD research. Outside of my studies and research, I enjoy long-distance running and cycling, backpacking, climbing, drawing, and photographing nature.

**Treasurer: Zheming Liu**


I’m Zheming a 3rd year PhD student in the OR track. I am interested in optimal transport, machine learning and geometry problems. I like to do sports, especially soccer and basketball.




**Technical Lead: Jason Bohne**



I’m Jason a 2nd year Ph.D. student within the quantitative finance track. My research broadly  focuses on statistical learning, nonparametric methods and optimization with financial applications. Outside of university I enjoy running, traveling , and trading.

**Secretary: Lydia Wang**


Hi everyone! I am the Secretary of Stony Brook University’s SIAM student chapter, and I am a first year undergraduate student studying Applied Math and Stats. Although I haven’t had the chance to do research as an undergraduate yet, I have done research at Stony Brook’s Garcia Summer Program that dealt with computational biology! I've also pursued my interests with math through volunteering at the National Museum of Mathematics in NYC. Outside of school, I enjoy playing the guitar and piano, and badminton with friends.
